          At first, Reality Club was just a group of 3 young people who wanted
          to save a compilation of their works. At that time, this group
          consisted of Fathia Izzati (vocals), Era Patigo (drums), and Mayo
          (bass). The vocalist, Fathia Izzati, was originally a YouTuber who
          often covered songs. Until Mayo invited Fathia and Era to form a band.
          Because she felt that the formation was lacking, Fathia invited her
          brother, Faiz Novascotia (guitar and vocals) and her boyfriend, Iqbal
          Anggakusumah (guitar) to join. Since then, the five of them have
          formed a music group which is currently known as Reality Club.
          Unfortunately, Mayo had to leave after 6 months when Reality Club was
          formed and was replaced by Nugi Wicaksono. Reality Club is a truly
          original indie music group. Because they made "home-made" songs in the
          guitarist's room, Faiz. In fact, they admitted that they had recorded
          their first album in the closet to produce the best songs like songs
          recorded in the studio. Uniquely, Reality Club's music is inspired by
          many foreign musicians, such as Arctic Monkeys, Two Doors Cinema Club,
          and Last Dinosaurs. Until 2017, Reality Club succeeded in releasing a
          debut album entitled Never Get Better, one of the songs in which
          became Reality Club's hit, namely the single 'Is It The Answer'. Then
          in 2019, Reality Club released their second album entitled What Do You
          Really Know?. With the target of appearing all over the world, Reality
          Club continues to produce cool works. Until 2019, they successfully
          toured at home and abroad. Most recently, they released another album
          entitled Reality Club Presents in May 2023. Unfortunately, Reality
          Club is not accompanied by guitarist Iqbal Anggakusumah on this album.
          The reason is, Iqbal decided to leave Reality Club at the end of 2022.
